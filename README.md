# Endermen Spawn with Blocks
A small tweak which makes Endermen more useful by having them spawn with blocks from other dimensions.

From now on, when encountering Endermen in your world, you will notice that some of them hold blocks from other dimensions you haven't yet visited. Overworld Endermen may hold Soul Sand, Endermen from The Nether can provide you with Purpur Blocks, while Endermen which spawn in The End sometimes carry... cakes? With this mod installed, there will be a brand new (although quite unreliable) way of getting resources from other dimensions without even leaving you own!

## Config options

This mod is also quite customizable, and you can change pretty much anything you don't like. Too many Endermen with blocks? Not a problem, you can change the chance in the config file. Endermen keep placing weird blocks on The End island? You can blacklist them from placing blocks in certain dimension (by the way, The End is blacklisted by default). Additionaly, you can also blacklist any blocks which you think Endermen shouldn't be able to spawn with - I'm looking at you, Jukebox.
